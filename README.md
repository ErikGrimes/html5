# HTML library for Dart / DDC (polymerize)

This library is an HTML library generated by [html_wrapper_generator](https://github.com/dam0vm3nt/html_wrapper_generator) 
starting from webidl files (stolen from the `firefox` project and then adapted).

It leverages the `@JS` interop Dart layer and aims to completely replace the (at the moment) out dated `dart:html` library.

As a separate package from the `SDK` this library has the main advantage to be updated more frequently.

Notably this library adds support to latest standards:
 
 - WebComponents v1
 - ShadowDom

## How to test it

At the moment this library only works on `DDC` and with `polymerize`. It will be eventually ported to `dart2js` and to `dazel`.

To build the sample demo just follow these instructions:

 1. install `polymerize`
  
    pub global activate polymerize

 2. prepare the project

    polymerie init --rules-version=v0.0.11

 3. build it with bazel

    bazel build html

The build result will be in the `bazel-bin` folder from where you can serve it.

## Caveats

Tested only for `chrome`. Firefox should work apart from some support for html import that's still missing.
